When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  --> You would want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all of your work locally on your computer for a number of reasons. You may want to collaborate with another working on another machine, or you'd like to change computers for some reason and you'd like to push code remotely. You can house all of your code here on GitHub rather than having it on your computer, saving space as well.
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  --> You'd want to always pull changes manually rather than havig Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repo because you may not want those changes made locally to be available to the public on GitHub. There may be a feature that you'd rather have locally than pushing that change to GitHub, rather than the sync being done automatically. 
 Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
   --> Forks allow you to basically clone a repo from one person's GitHub page to another GitHub page, without having to locally push or pull any branches. Clones allow you to make a copy or 'clone' of any repo stored on GitHub provided a link, and pull it to a local repo. Branches allow you to maneuver or 'branch' off onto another version of code/ an experimental feature of a project, all stored either locally or remotely.
